If you are here, it's probably because you are searching too the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything : 
How much, our favorite customer, Napoleon Batz, spent in our shop?

The answer is...

42. 
No it's not, I'm kidding it's **200.06$**. Just see for yourself.

The Second question is also answered in this beautiful application made with Xcode and developped entirely in Swift.

We sold 5 Awesome Bronze Bags. Cool, huh?
